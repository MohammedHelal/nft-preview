## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite JS](https://vitejs.dev/) - React build tool

### What I learned

It was interesting working with the positioning and z-indexes to make the view svg image appear on top of the image on hover,
Understanding how positioning works on each other and how that affects the z-index values was what i learnt the most.

### Continued development

I will continue to practice the positioning and z-indexing until I'm comfortable with them.

### Useful resources

- [StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33925507/z-index-flickering-in-chrome-on-hover#:~:text=It's%20flickering%20because%20the%20element,relative%20to%20the%20parent%20element.) - This answer on stack overflow helped me understand what was happening with my code and why the view was flickering and not appearing properly.
